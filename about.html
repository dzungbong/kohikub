				<h3>I'm a coffee lover</h3>
				<p>
					I always start my day with a shot of espresso, sometimes a double-shot. Even when I go out with friends, espresso is a must.
				</p>
				<h3>and I love "waste", too</h3>
				<p>
					After every single shot of espresso, I will have a spoon-full of coffee grounds. I drink coffee two to three times a day. Hence, I have about a handful of coffee grounds daily. I often use coffee grounds to feed my lovely garden. But, I guess they don't like coffee as much as I do! So, I ended-up collecting spent coffee grounds as a hobby. 
				</p>
				<h3>Here come the mug made from coffee grounds</h3>
				<p>
					As my "collection" grew, I started to ask myself what I should do with these guys? This question kept echoing in my mind. I googled and finally came up with an idea <a href="http://www.freewebsitetemplates.com/forums/">"mugs from coffee grounds"</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>What is that?</h3>
				<p>
					Research found out that spent-coffee grounds contain cellulose nano fibers, which is a natural linear polymer. Hmm, sounds complicated, eh? No worries! I had a tough time understanding this too. After trials and fails, my partners and I managed to mix used plastic bottled and coffee grounds, and..Tada! We call it Kohikub! A repurposed plastic material that will be used in our products, ranging from tablewares to furniture items.
